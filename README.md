# Hospital-Triage-System

Project Team Members: Lukas DeLoach, Emma Zimmerman, Iker Martinez, Kat Saburov, and Neiloy Hossain

Project Goal: To facilitate movement in Hospital during Emergencies.

How it’s Socially Relevant: There are about 5,500 people who die daily because of long delays in Hospital Waits. They don’t get treated right away, and it becomes difficult to keep track of Patients waiting.

Requirements: Stores patient symptoms as well as their information. Places patients in an ordered queue based on the severity of their symptoms
Shows doctor/nurse availability and assigns patients to available doctor/nurse
